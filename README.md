## Amateur Earthling, Ph.D.

I'm a former space explorer, marooned with you on a beautiful, dying world.
I work to preserve the continued habitability of that world as a Data Liberation Engineer and member-owner of [Catalyst Cooperative](https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative).

We build open data pipelines that turn public energy system data into analysis ready products for use by activists, modelers, policy makers, researchers, small businesses, journalists, and others who have historically had poor access to this kind of information.
The work is a mix of software engineering, data wrangling, data engineering, archiving, and public outreach.

Outside of work I travel by bike and kayak, prefer car-free cities, and try to enjoy life without consuming many material or financial resources.
Sometimes I blog at [Amateur Earthling](https://amateurearthling.org).
I currently live in the misty Mayan highlands of southern Mexico, but am not particularly attached to any location.
